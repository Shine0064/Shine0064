I'm the kinda developer that just kinda does whatever.
I don't really stick to anything in particular, aside from me having been avoiding front-end... for some reason, I don't quite know why.
Lately I've been primarily using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) for pretty much anything, so take that how you will.

Almost all of my repos are, and will stay private. Simple reason for that is embarrassment.
